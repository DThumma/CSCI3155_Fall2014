_1. Scala Basics: Binding and Scope.  For each of the following uses of names, give the line where_
   _that name is bound.  Briefly explain your reasoning (1-2 sentences)._

  _(a) The use of pi at line 4 is bound at which line?  The use of pi at line 7 is bound at which_
       _line?_
    
    i.  The use of pi at line 4 is bound at line 3 where we find "val pi = 3.14159". This is the 
        latest declaration of pi within the same scope as its use on line 4.  The computer will look
        here first to find the value assigned to pi referenced at line 4.
    
    ii. The use of pi at line 7 is bound at line 1 since this location is where pi is last defined
        within the same scope.

  _(b) The use of x at line 3 is bound at which line? The use of x at line 6 is bound at which line?_
      _The use of x at line 10 is bound at which line? The use of x at line 13 is bound at which line?_
    
    i.   The use of x at line 3 is bound at line 2 where it is being passed into the function f()and 
         is in the same scope as the reference of x in line 3.  
    
    ii.  The use of x at line 6 is bound at line 5 since this location was the last place where the 
         computer referenced the value of x. It is also within the same scope as case x.
         
    iii. The use of x at line 10 is also bound at line 5 since the last direct reference to its value 
         occurred there and it is within the same scope as case x.
    
    iv.  The use of x at line 13 is bound at line 1 since it is the only definition of x within its
         scope.
    
_2. Scala Basics: Typing. In the following, I have left off the return type of function g.  The body_
   _of g is well-typed if we can come up with a valid return type.  Is the body of g well-typed?_
   _If so, give the return type of g (see above in **bold font type**) and explain how you determined_
   _this type._
   
   
     line 1      def g(x: Int) **tuple:( (Int, Int), Int )** = {
     line 2          val (a, b) = (1, (x, 3))
     line 3          if( x == 0 ) (b, 1) else (b, a + 2)
     line 4      }
    
    Explanation for choosing type tuple:( (Int, Int), Int ):
    As mentioned in the problem, the body of a function is well-typed only if the return type is
    valid.  The validity of the return type and therefore the well-typed status of the function g
    depends on consistency. The return type we chose is held consistent throughout the function.
    Therefore, our answer to the above question is, "Yes, the body expression of function g is 
    well-typed." 
       
      i.  (b, 1):( (Int, Int), Int ) because       // if( x == 0)
               b: (Int, Int) because               // per definition of b on line 2
                   (x, 3): (Int, Int) because 	  
                        x: Int                     // per declaration in parameter field

               1: Int
      ii. (b, a + 2): ( (Int, Int), Int ) because  // if( x != 0)
               b: (Int, Int) because               // per definition of b on line 2
                    (x, 3): (Int, Int) because 	 
                         x: Int                    // per declaration in parameter field
               a + 2: Int because
                   a: Int because                  // per definition of a on line 2                
                   2: Int
